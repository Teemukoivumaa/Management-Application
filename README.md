I came up with a Management Application to look at employee, customer, and
product information. The project's main program is implemented in C ++ and QT using. In
addition, I run my own MYSQL database on my Raspberry Pi, where the program gets it the
information they need.

I made this project because I wanted to challenge myself and make an application.

For this project I used QT. QT made creating this application easy. Still I had many challenges like with every project. I used my Raspberry Pi 2B as MySql database host, so I could access it even if I wasn't at home.
